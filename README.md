# IR Hauptseminar 16/17 examples

## Compiling

Most of the examples will be in Rust. If you want to run them, install
[rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/) and use nightly:

~~~{.bash}
$ rustup install nightly
$ rustup default nightly
~~~

You can then use build, test, or benchmark a program by going to one of
the program directories and running (respectively):

~~~{.bash}
$ cargo build
$ cargo test
$ cargo bench
~~~

Let me know if you have trouble understanding one of the programs. I can
cover it in more depth during the lecture or provide a Java/Python
implementation.

## Disclaimer

Most (if not all) of these are just toy examples.
